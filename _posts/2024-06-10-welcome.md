# Introduction

Hey there, I'm Anish.

At the time of writing this post, I'm a final-year university student completing my Bachelor of IT with a Co-op scholarship at the University of Technology Sydney. I've got experience programming in various languages like Python, Javascript, Java, and C#, and I've got internship experience as both a Junior Data Scientist and a Full Stack Software Developer. At my latest internship I was part of a backend and frontend team, developing in both .NET and React for a subscription management service at a dataroom company (Ansarada) - think mergers and acquisitions but done securely on the cloud. I also got really into AI and Machine Learning during this time and built a bunch of tools and chatbots for internal use by the go-to-market team. At my internship before, I worked as Junior Data Scientist, playing around with oil and gas pump data for a major energy company (Origin Energy).

Both were really rewarding experiences. I learnt heaps about the industry, about the importance of workplace culture, and how on-the-job learning trumps almost all the knowledge and skills you get from university. These experiences were truly insightful and I'm super grateful for them, however, I've discovered that my skills and competencies in computer science + programming + technology have not greatly improved. In fact, I would say my skills have optimised for the minimum amount of knowledge required to achieve the minimum threshold of quality.

I don't consider myself particularly 'efficient' or 'effective' at programming yet. I have a deep passion for computer science and programming but I've never really given myself the time to dig deep and learn the fundamentals. I didn't have time because I had to be pragmatic - go down the usual path, learn Javascript, learn React, get some plug-and-play web apps under your belt and boom, you're qualified. Anything else and you're risking your ability to land a role or get paid at a competitive rate. Moreover, I was was in the "I-am-the-next-steve-jobs" phase of my life where every solution was in search of a problem and every problem... wasn't really a problem... but I built a web app that could scale to 100,000 users just in case. This desire to make heaps of money while I was still young further fed into this need to be pragmatic and only learn what was necessary and most efficient. Why learn Javascript back-to-front when I only needed to learn enough to build a functioning web app? Why learn how to build a UI when there are Figma extensions that generated the code for those UI's? In the age of Github Co-pilot, why even learn to program?

My answer to these questions aligns with the following quote:

"The fastest way to a small success is not always the fastest way to a big success"

By learning these surface level skills, I was most certainly setting myself up for a lucrative position straight out of university - but for how long? How valuable were the skills I collected? Plugging micro-services together was not really a valuable skill - in fact, it was built to be a replaceable skill, thats why they're micro-services, they're lego pieces you can plug together while all the complexity is abstracted away. What did I really know about computer science and programming? I didn't know much if anything at all about data structures, or algorithms, or anything really beyond for loops and conditional statements. I knew enough to get by. I was a professional "frameworker" and knew how to get API's to talk to each other, but I had never learnt lower-level concepts or fundamentals.

So, I've decided its time to dig deep and really learn whats really going on under all these layers of abstraction.
